Abstract: 
In this modernized world, where time is money, everyone has got the habit of doing their tasks online. Within a click, a task is done. You get this application to make transactions just by sitting in your comfort zone. Every operation like money transfer and balance inquiry can be done in seconds. 

Introduction:
It is a simple Banking Application. I learnt about scanner class to take inputs, and the basics of strings, loops, methods, and conditional statements. Here, simple banking operations like deposit, withdrawal, checking balance, exit, etc. 

Explanation:
Java is a powerful programming language that is commonly used for building enterprise-level applications. One of the most popular application domains for Java is banking. Java provides a robust set of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to develop a banking application.

 Our application will have the following basic functionality:

1. NEW ACCOUNT
2. DEPOSIT ACCOUNT
3. WITHDRAW ACCOUNT
4. BALANCE ENQUIRY
5. ALL ACCOUNT HOLDER LIST
6. CLOSE AN ACCOUNT
7. MODIFY AN ACCOUNT
8. EXIT
The first step in building our application is to create a new Java project. We will use the command-line interface to create a new project and set up the project structure. Once the project is set up, we can start writing the code for our application.

The main class of our application will be called “Bank”. In this class, we will define the main method and the basic functionality of our application. The main method will be responsible for displaying the menu to the user and handling the user’s input.

The menu will consist of eight options:

1. NEW ACCOUNT
2. DEPOSIT ACCOUNT
3. WITHDRAW ACCOUNT
4. BALANCE ENQUIRY
5. ALL ACCOUNT HOLDER LIST
6. CLOSE AN ACCOUNT
7. MODIFY AN ACCOUNT
8. EXIT
The user will be prompted to select an option by entering a number between 1 and 8. If the user enters an invalid option, the application will display an error message and prompt the user to enter a valid option
